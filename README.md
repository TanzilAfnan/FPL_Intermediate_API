# Open FPL
This is a REST API for [Premier Lgue](https://www.premierleague.com) data which are used for [Fantasy Premier League](https://fantasy.premierleague.com). The data comes from the official FPL Open API. But the problem with the Official API is that it is heard to apprehend. And that's where this APi comes in.  

The goal of this API is to restructure and reform the original FPL API data in a more readable and usable structure so that Premier League fans like us can use this to create awesome applications.
